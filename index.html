               <h2>Accounting</h2>
               <p class="funParagraph">
         
                 Over a decade ago, I somehow decided that I wanted to make my living as an accountant. I was better than average at math and incorrectly assumed that math had any significant part to play in accounting. After a couple of years in business school, the most I learned was how and when to manipulate inventory management methods and dividends to protect corporations from paying their fair share of taxes.

               <h2>Waitressing</h2>
               <p>
                  While giving it the old college try, I had to make a short-term living to support myself and fund my studies. This short-term solution ended up lasting about 9 years. On par with just about anyone in this industry, I jumped between 6 different restaurants equally dissatisfied with each one. It became abundantly clear to me that customer service was not my future.

               <h2>Dance Instructing</h2>
               <p>
                  It all started when a friend of mine dragged me to a pole dancing class that I thought I'd hate. It turns out I loved it. I would go on to perform, compete, and eventually teach. Though never full-time nor a reliable source of money, teaching pole dance classes was probably the most fun I've ever had at a job. My obligatory disclaimer when sharing this interest with others is as follows: pole dancing is not just for clubs. I taught classes just as any fitness instructor would teach yoga, pilates, kickboxing, etc. Seeing the strength and confidence in my students grow was extraordinarily rewarding.

               <h2>Welding</h2>
               <p>
                  Because I didn't have a varied enough repertoire, I found another unique passion that is welding. This idea for a career came from my dad's suggestion to look at trade work as opposed to jobs that required many years of higher education. I was a good student but my (at the time undiagnosed) ADHD was hindering me greatly. After touring JCCC's various trades classes, I felt myself drawn to welding the most. I've been at my current job for over 2 years welding veterinary equipment including kennels, steps, washtubs, gates, and doors. It remains a passion that I do want to keep, but my body has already begun to protest this life choice.

               <h2>Coding</h2>
               <p>
                  To make nearly a full circle, I have decided to come back to the world of sitting in front of a computer for hours on end frustrated by what I see. I am still good at math and I continue to recognize how much that skill isn't needed. Accounting taught me how to manage expectations; waitressing taught me resilience and empathy; dancing taught me awareness and community; welding taught me how to stay calm and not jump too much when you get burned. I intend to apply all of these talents, in some way, as I move into a career in tech.
